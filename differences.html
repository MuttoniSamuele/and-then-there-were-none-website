        <h1>Differences between the book and the TV Series</h1>
        <p>The TV series has a lot of differences from the book.<br>Here are the main ones:</p>
        <ul class="elenco">
          <li>In the TV series, the island’s name is “Soldier island”, while in the book it is “Indians island”.</li>
          <li>In the book, the guests arrive at Nigger Island all together except for Dr. Armstrong, who arrives later, while in the TV series Emily Brent and Anthony Marston take the boat before the others.</li>
          <li>Beatrice Taylor, in the book, doesn’t get run over by a train, but throws herself into a river.</li>
          <li>Mr and Mrs Rogers suffocate the elderly lady they were supposed to care for with a pillow (instead of not giving her the medicines and call the doctor late);</li>
          <li>Blore does not give false testimony to have an innocent man go to prison who then dies there, but he beats up to kill an innocent boy just because the latter was homosexual and he is a mad homophobe.</li>
          <li>In the book, after the finding of the butler's dead body, Vera has a hysterical fit and the doctor slaps her to get her back; in the TV series it is the opposite.</li>
          <li>In the book, Rogers notices the disappearing statuettes. In the TV series it is Vera who finds out.</li>
          <li>Marston, in the series, is addicted to drugs, but this isn’t mentioned in the book.</li>
          <li>In the TV series Vera Claythorne tries to escape from the island, but this doesn’t happen in the book.</li>
          <li>In the novel, she spots a bee and is injected with a drug via hypodermic needle. In the series, she is stabbed with her own knitting needles.</li>
          <li>In the book, Vera feels Cyril's hand touching her, which turns out to be a seaweed hanging from the ceiling, specially made to scare her. In the TV series, however, the facts are different. Cyril grabs her hand from the sink.</li>
          <li>In the series, after Wargrave's death, the survivors have a party, however this doesn’t happen in the book.</li>
          <li>In the book, Blore dies crushed by a bear-shaped clock, in the series he is killed with a knife that was inside a bear fur rug.</li>
          <li>Nowhere in the book Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard show their love, the love between these two is only added to the series to make it more modern.</li>
          <li>The ending of the book is different. Vera hangs herself without knowing who the murderer is, while in the series Judge Wargrave appears and explains everything before pushing the chair. In the film, no Wargrave manuscripts are found, and the two cops in the series do not appear.</li>
